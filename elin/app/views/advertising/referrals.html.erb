<h2>E-Lien Referral System</h2>
<br>
<b>SAVE MONEY</b> by greatly reducing your office staff's time spent on the phone tracking down patient information and <b>MAKE MORE MONEY</b> by letting other medical providers know you provide lien based services and they can easily send you business.

<h3><span style="color:red;">New!</span> Receive All Information via Email</h3><br>
The E-Lien Referral System no longer requires you to use your account to access referral information.  All involved parties information is now sent via Email.  You can, of course, still import referrals into your account <small>(see below)</small>.
<h3>How E-Lien Referrals saves your staff time</h3>
<br>
E-Lien allows you to manage your liens, complete with patient's and defendant's insurance information.  Wouldn't it be great if all of that information was available to import into your account before the patient even walks through the door?  That is exactly what the <b>E-Lien Referrals System</b> will do for you.<br><br>
Staff will no longer have to call referring offices or attorneys to track down the information required to file a lien.  Also,  E-Lien Referrals cuts down the risk of human error by eliminating the task of copying information by hand.

<h3>How E-Lien Referrals increases business</h3>
<br>
E-Lien Referrals give you an advertisement under the appropriate category that potential referrers browse daily.  Being in the directory lets potential referrers know you offer lien based services and brings you more business.
